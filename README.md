# RSI with Alert

RSI with Alert is an indicator for MT4 and MT5 by EarnForex.com. It is based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator. It finds points where the RSI line either goes out of the boundary levels or returns into the boundary levels. It can also detect crosses of arbitrarily drawn horizontal lines in its subwindow. This indicator supports all types of alerts.

The indicator draws its arrows in the main chart window while the RSI itself is displayed in the separate chart window.

It is a non-repainting indicator.
